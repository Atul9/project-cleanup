## New features
:sparkles: **Custom cleaning**! Create .cleanuprc files to define which directories should be cleaned on a per-project basis.

## Improvements
:zap: The application should run even faster now, due to cleanup & improvements in the codebase.

## Known Bugs
:x: Installing through npm may error on Windows until [this issue in a dependency](https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper/binary-install/issues/1) is fixed.

## Notes
:tornado: This version had several _rc_ releases while I was figuring out how to set up Github Actions.
